Metasploitable is an operating system designed to be easily exploited to conduct penetration tests and enhance security to prevent short, medium, or long-term attacks.

## What is Metasploitable

It is a Linux system developed with high-security vulnerabilities where we can carry out all the necessary tests to perfect security techniques or understand how to maximize the use of applications designed for this purpose. Metasploitable does not have a graphical environment and is recommended for use exclusively in private networks due to its vulnerability to attacks. It is open source and allows vulnerability testing in embedded files, file attributes, permissions, etc. Next, we will see how to install Metasploitable on VirtualBox to perform various tests according to each one's needs.

### Prerequisites

For this, you will need the following:

- [VIRTUALBOX](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/)

To start the process, create the virtual machine in VirtualBox by clicking on the **New** icon at the top and entering the following values in the displayed window:

Click **Next**, and in the next window, you can leave the RAM value as default, 2048MB, or assign a bit more if desired.

Here is the translation to English:

Click on **Next** and then Finish.

![Terminar](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/terminar.png?raw=true)

Now, click on the **Start** button to begin the system installation process.

![Iniciar sistema](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/iniciar-sistema.png?raw=true)

This process takes around 5 minutes, and you will see the following:

![Iniciar sistema2](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/iniciar-sistema2.png?raw=true)

The access credentials are:

- **Username: msfadmin**
- **Password: msfadmin**

![Credenciales de acceso](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/credenciales-de-acceso.png?raw=true)

This way, you can use Metasploitable with all the necessary tests.
