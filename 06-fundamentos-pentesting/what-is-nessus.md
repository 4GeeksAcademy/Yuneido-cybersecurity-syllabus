[Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) is a vulnerability scanning program for all operating systems, **consists of a nessusd** daemon that performs the scan of the target operating system, and Nessus the client that displays the progress and reports everything it finds in the different scans. In addition, it can be run both at the console level by commands or also with a graphical user interface. First, it starts by performing a port scan, since it is the first thing that is usually done in a pentesting; this program makes use of the power of Nmap for it, although it also has its scanner of open ports.

[Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) is one of the most used and famous tools in ethical hacking, as it makes the work of an auditor much easier, automating the search for vulnerabilities to waste as little time as possible in detecting security flaws. Nessus has a very intuitive and user-friendly interface, and you can tell from the first moment that it is a very complete commercial tool. It aims to be practical and complicate the work as little as possible. Nessus also comes with a tool to export the scan results to PDF or other similar formats so that you can attach them to your report.

Once you have identified the services that are running, you can start using the tools to identify vulnerabilities in the services. Nessus uses a set of plugins to perform the scans. Each plugin focuses on a specific type of vulnerability. For example, one plugin may look for vulnerabilities in web server software, while another plugin may look for vulnerabilities in email software.

Nessus has an extensive database of known vulnerabilities in different services and, for each of these, has plugins that run to identify whether the vulnerability exists (or not) on a particular target machine. In short, by running Nessus without specific parameters, thousands of vulnerabilities will be tested, and the result will be a list of the vulnerabilities that were identified. The logic of Nessus is similar to Nmap: you have to indicate the target, in this case, the IP address(es), and the parameters. These allow the search field to be narrowed down, especially if the services were identified at an earlier stage: it makes no sense to search for known vulnerabilities on Linux on a computer with Windows installed.

The tool has, in addition to its console execution, a user-friendly graphical interface for those who are taking their first steps in the world of pentesting. We can say that it is a whole suite of work for auditors. This tool has two modalities, a free one called Essentials and a paid one oriented to companies called Professional, which you can try with a 7-day demo. There are very famous alternatives to Nessus such as [OpenVas](https://www.openvas.org/) which also has a free version. For learning purposes Nessus omits the whole process of vulnerability detection at a low level, you will be able to detect vulnerabilities, but it does not show you the essence of the attack.

Some very important features of Nessus are that it has very few false positives, has a large vulnerability coverage, and is widely used throughout the security industry, so it is almost continuously updated to incorporate the latest technologies and security flaws.
