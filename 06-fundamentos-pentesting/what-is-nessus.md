Nessus is one of the most widely used vulnerability scanners in the industry. It is highly favored for its comprehensive vulnerability scanning capabilities, ease of use, and detailed reporting features. Organizations across various industries, including finance, healthcare, and government, rely on Nessus for regular vulnerability assessments, compliance checks, and risk management.

**Nessus helps auditors** by automating vulnerability assessments and compliance checks, generating detailed and customizable reports, and providing remediation guidance. It enables continuous monitoring, asset discovery, and trend analysis, allowing auditors to track security improvements and verify that issues are resolved. Nessus supports regulatory audits by meeting compliance requirements and offering evidence through comprehensive reports, ultimately making the audit process more efficient, accurate, and focused on high-risk areas.

Nessus is particularly popular in environments where regular vulnerability scanning, compliance auditing, and detailed reporting are required. It is often used by security teams in larger organizations with established security processes.

   - **Access the Nessus Web Interface:** Open a web browser and navigate to `https://localhost:8834`. This will bring up the Nessus web interface.
   - **Create an Account:** On your first visit, you'll need to create a Nessus user account by providing a username, password, and an activation code (if using Nessus Professional).
   - **Choose a Product:** Select the type of Nessus you're using (e.g., Nessus Essentials, Nessus Professional) and enter the activation Download - 
   - **Download Plugins**: After activation, Nessus will automatically download and install the latest plugins. Plugins are critical as they contain the logic for detecting specific vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and compliance issues. This initial download may take some time, depending on your network speed and the number of plugins being installed.
### 3. **Configure Nessus Scans**
   - **Create a New Scan:** 
     - Click on the “New Scan” button in the Nessus web interface.
     - Choose a scan template based on your needs (e.g., Basic Network Scan, Advanced Scan, Web Application Tests).
   - **Configure Scan Settings:**
     - **Name the Scan:** Provide a name and description for your scan.
     - **Define the Targets:** Enter the IP addresses, ranges, or subnets you want to scan.
     - **Customize Scan Options:** Depending on the template, you can configure advanced options such as scan scheduling, port range, and plugin selection.

### 4. **Run the Scan**
   - **Launch the Scan:** After configuring the scan settings, click the "Save" button, and then "Launch" to start the scan.
   - **Monitor the Scan:** You can monitor the progress of the scan in real-time via the web interface. Nessus will display the status, including the number of hosts scanned and any vulnerabilities detected.

### 5. **Analyze the Results**
   - **View the Scan Results:** Once the scan is complete, you can click on the scan name to view the detailed results.
   - **Filter and Sort Vulnerabilities:** Use filters to sort vulnerabilities by severity, CVSS score, or type. Nessus provides a detailed description, risk factor, and remediation recommendations for each detected vulnerability.
   - **Generate Reports:** You can export the results in various formats, such as PDF, HTML, CSV, or XML, for further analysis or reporting. This is useful for sharing findings with stakeholders or keeping records for compliance.

### 6. **Remediation**
   - **Review Remediation Recommendations:** For each detected vulnerability, Nessus provides specific guidance on how to remediate the issue, such as applying patches or reconfiguring systems.
   - **Implement Fixes:** Based on the recommendations, work with your IT team to address the vulnerabilities. This may involve applying software updates, changing configurations, or other actions.

### 7. **Rescan to Verify Fixes**
   - **Re-run the Scan:** After implementing the fixes, it’s a good practice to rerun the scan to ensure that the vulnerabilities have been properly addressed.
   - **Compare Results:** Use Nessus’s comparison feature to view differences between scans and confirm that issues have been resolved.

### 8. **Schedule Regular Scans**
   - **Set Up Regular Scans:** To maintain security, schedule regular scans to continuously monitor your network and systems for new vulnerabilities.
   - **Automate Reporting:** You can configure Nessus to automatically generate and email reports after each scheduled scan.

### 9. **Stay Updated**

   - **Keep Nessus Up-to-Date:** Regularly update the Nessus software itself to take advantage of new features and security improvements.

By following these steps, you can effectively use Nessus to identify and manage vulnerabilities within your network, helping to secure your infrastructure against potential threats.

## Vulnerability Database

Nessus has an extensive database of known vulnerabilities in different services and, for each of these, has plugins that run to identify whether the vulnerability exists (or not) on a particular target machine. In short, by running Nessus without specific parameters, thousands of vulnerabilities will be tested, and the result will be a list of identified vulnerabilities. The logic of Nessus is similar to Nmap: you have to indicate the target, in this case, the IP address(es), and the parameters. These allow the search field to be narrowed down, especially if the services were identified at an earlier stage: it makes no sense to search for known vulnerabilities on Linux on a computer with Windows installed.

## False positives

Some important features of Nessus are that it has few false positives, has a large vulnerability coverage, and is widely used throughout the security industry, so it is almost continuously updated to incorporate the latest technologies and security flaws.
