> Function: Penetration testing development framework with exploit modules.
 
> Usage: Exploit automation and security testing.

[Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/) is one of the best open source tools that allow us to locate and exploit security vulnerabilities in systems and services, this tool is essential for pentesting. The most popular project is Metasploit Framework, which is installed by default in Linux distributions such as Kali Linux. Thanks to the power of Metasploit, we can perform penetration tests to services, applications, and other attacks. It is one of the tools that you must have in your arsenal of tools for pentesting, it complements the other tools we have discussed above. Metasploit has a large community behind it, and tools based on it have been designed to greatly facilitate all tasks by automating them.

Metasploit is a penetration testing framework that is used to perform a wide range of attacks against systems and applications. It is a powerful tool that can be used by experienced pentesters, but it is also relatively easy to learn to use for beginners. Metasploit is based on a database of exploits, which are programs that exploit known vulnerabilities in systems and applications. The framework provides an easy-to-use interface for searching and selecting exploits, as well as executing them. This tool makes the job of finding vulnerabilities much easier because it is not necessary to work at a low level to exploit bugs. Metasploit automates that work and makes it very easy to analyze and exploit a software flaw. There is a lot of free documentation to learn how to use Metasploit, so it will not be difficult to learn how to use this tool.

[Armitage](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/armitage/) is another tool that provides a free visual layer for using Metasploit. With this software you will be able to use Metasploit without the need to use it with commands, everything is done visually. This makes it even easier to use for people who are not familiar with the Metasploit terminal and are learning.

[Cobalt Strike](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/) is another visual layer for Metasploit with the difference over Armitage that it is paid. This tool is clearly an improved version of Armitage that allows you to do the same, but with more features and even incorporates other tools to improve its practicality, such as [Mimikatz](https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz).

Once the command to start the tool has been executed, we will have access to a command terminal in the tool. Here we will be able to choose among the exploits already loaded for the exploit and select one of them. Then, we must configure parameters specific to the exploit we have chosen, such as, for example, the IP or target ports, HTTP listening servers, and more. Finally, we can start running the exploit.
