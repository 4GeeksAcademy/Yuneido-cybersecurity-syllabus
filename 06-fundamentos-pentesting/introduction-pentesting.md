Pentesting, or penetration testing, is an IT security assessment methodology that simulates cyber attacks to evaluate the resistance of a system, network, or application to potential threats. It consists of identifying and exploiting security vulnerabilities in order to improve defenses and strengthen the security posture.

## Objectives of Pentesting

- Vulnerability Identification: Discovering potential security breaches and weaknesses in systems and networks.
- Risk Assessment: Assess the severity of discovered vulnerabilities and their potential impact on system security.
- Attack Surface Mapping: Understand the infrastructure and applications that may be targets of a real attack.
- Security Controls Validation: Verify the effectiveness of security measures implemented in an environment, such as firewalls, detection systems, and access policies.
- Continuous Improvement: Provide specific recommendations to improve security, allowing organizations to take corrective and preventive measures.
- Awareness: Raise awareness among security teams and the organization in general about the importance of maintaining a proactive posture in the face of potential threats.
- Incident Preparedness: Helping organizations to be better prepared to respond to security incidents by identifying vulnerabilities early and improving response protocols.
- Pentesting is an essential practice in modern cybersecurity, providing a practical and realistic assessment of an organization's security posture.

## Types of Pentesting

| Black Box Pentesting | In this test the tester performs his analysis completely blind, i.e. without any information whatsoever about the system to be evaluated. Therefore, the attack will be carried out as if it were performed by someone completely external to the company. In the same way that simulations of air attacks are carried out, with black box pentesting it is possible to simulate a cyber attack on your computer system, whether by a hacker or a cybercriminal. |

| White Box Pentesting | In this type of test the tester knows all the data of the system to be evaluated (passwords, firewalls or IPs of the computer system, among others). Therefore, the attack is simulated as if it were carried out by an insider, i.e. someone who is part of the company. It is the most complete Pentesting test that a computer system can undergo and with which it is possible to detect with great precision the improvable aspects of its defenses. |
| Grey Box Pentesting | This test is an intermediate or mixture of the two previous ones. In this case, the tester will have some information when performing the test, although it is still a good simulation of an attack outside the system. |

## Where do pentesters work?

Generally in one of three environments.

- **Internal:** As an internal penetration tester, you work directly for a company or organization. This usually gives you a good understanding of the company's security protocols. You also get to learn more about new features and security fixes.
- **Security firm:** Some organizations hire an outside security firm to generate penetration tests. Working for a security firm offers a greater variety in the types of tests you will be able to design and perform.
- **Freelance:** Some choose to work as a freelancer. Choosing this path may give you greater flexibility in your schedule, but you may have to spend more time looking for clients early in your career.

## Difference between pentesting and security testing

### Scope:
- **Pentesting:** Focuses on simulating a real cyber-attack, replicating an attacker's tactics to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
- **Security Testing:** Can address a wider range of assessments, including static and dynamic analysis, code review, configuration evaluation, among others.

### Approach:
- **Pentesting:** Has a broader and more realistic approach, evaluating security from an attacker's perspective.
- **Security Testing:** May address more specific aspects of security, such as reviewing security configurations, performing static code analysis, or evaluating security policies.

### Depth of Evaluation:
- **Pentesting:** Dives deep into vulnerability exploitation, seeking to simulate a real attack and evaluate system resilience.
- **Security Testing:** Can be broader and less focused on exploitation, covering different aspects of security without necessarily reaching direct exploitation.

### Objective:
- **Pentesting:** Seeks not only to identify vulnerabilities, but also to demonstrate how they could be exploited and what impact they would have on security.
- **Security Testing:** May focus on identifying vulnerabilities without necessarily carrying out a detailed exploitation.

### Nature:
- **Pentesting:** It is more action-oriented, simulating an attack in real time.
- **Security Testing:** Can be more static, focused on analysis and evaluation without direct exploit actions.

### Frequency:
- Pentesting: Generally performed periodically to evaluate security at different times and situations.
- **Security Testing:** May be more continuous and integrated into the software development cycle.

> üí° Both practices are complementary and it is common to use them in a comprehensive security program. Pentesting is often considered an essential part of security testing, but it does not represent its entirety. Security testing addresses a broader spectrum of assessments that go beyond simulating an actual attack.

### Pentester Roles and Responsibilities

The roles and responsibilities of a pentester are fundamental to ensure the effectiveness and success of security testing. Here are the main aspects:

- **Information Gathering:** Obtain relevant data about the target system, such as network information, technologies used and possible entry points.
- **Vulnerability Analysis:** Identify and assess possible vulnerabilities in the target system through scanning and analysis techniques.
- **Vulnerability Exploitation:** Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities to verify their exploitability and assess potential impact.
- **Application Security Testing:** Evaluate the security of web and mobile applications, identifying potential vulnerabilities such as SQL injections, XSS, CSRF, etc.
- **Network Testing:** Evaluate the security of network infrastructure, identifying vulnerabilities in configurations, devices and protocols.
- **Social Engineering Testing:** Simulate social engineering attacks to assess staff resistance to manipulation and raise awareness of potential threats.
- **Report Writing:** Documenting in a clear and detailed manner all activities performed, findings, identified risks and recommendations.
- **Collaboration with the Security Team:** Work closely with the security team to understand the organization's policies, procedures and specific needs.
- **Tool Development and Automation:** Contribute to the development and enhancement of automated tools to increase testing efficiency and effectiveness.
- **Training and Awareness:** Provide guidance and training to staff on security best practices and raise awareness of current threats.
- **Knowledge Maintenance:** Keep updated on the latest threats, vulnerabilities and ethical hacking techniques.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è A pentester must be ethical, possess advanced technical skills, understand the current threat landscape and be able to effectively communicate risks and recommendations to different levels of the organization. Confidentiality and integrity are key aspects of performing these responsibilities.

## Ethical and Legal Considerations in Penetration Testing

These tools are merely an introduction, and their specific use will depend on the scope and requirements of each pentesting project. It is crucial for pentesters to understand how these tools operate and their ethical implications, as well as to adhere to applicable laws and regulations during penetration testing. Penetration tests, although essential for assessing system security, must be conducted with strict adherence to ethical and legal considerations.

### Ethical Considerations:

- Informed Consent: Obtain written consent from the owner of the system or network before conducting any penetration testing.
- Proportionality and Justification: Ensure that the tests are proportionate and justified, avoiding unnecessary or intrusive damage.
- Confidentiality: Maintain the confidentiality of any sensitive information or data obtained during the tests.
- Reporting of Results: Clearly and comprehensively inform the system owner about findings and vulnerabilities discovered, and provide recommendations for mitigation.
- Professional Integrity: Act with integrity and professionalism throughout all stages of the testing process, avoiding inappropriate or malicious behavior.

### Legal Considerations:

- Legal Authorization: Obtain legal permissions and authorizations to conduct penetration testing on systems and networks to prevent legal actions against oneself.
- Local Laws and Regulations: Understand and comply with all local, state, and national laws and regulations related to penetration testing.
- Documentation: Maintain clear and detailed documentation of all activities conducted during the tests, including dates, times, results, and actions taken.
- Avoid Damaging or Exploiting Sensitive Data: Avoid any actions that may damage data or exploit vulnerabilities with the purpose of obtaining sensitive information without explicit authorization.
- Scope Limits: Strictly adhere to the agreed-upon scope for the tests and refrain from exploring areas outside those limits without additional permission.
- Client Cooperation: Work closely with the client and their security team to ensure that tests are conducted safely and in accordance with established policies.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Failure to adhere to these ethical and legal considerations can result in serious consequences, including legal actions, loss of trust, and damage to the reputation of the security professional. It is crucial to collaborate closely with the client and other stakeholders to ensure that all parties are informed and committed throughout the penetration testing process.
