A vulnerability scanner is a software tool used to identify, assess and report vulnerabilities in computer systems, applications and networks. Its main objective is to discover security weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers to compromise the integrity, confidentiality or availability of systems.

### Main functionalities of a Vulnerability Scanner

1. **Vulnerability Detection.**
   - **Network Scanning:** Identifies devices and systems connected to the network, as well as open services and ports.
   - **Web Application Scanning:** Looks for common vulnerabilities in web applications, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and misconfiguration.
   - **Configuration Review:** Evaluates system and application configurations to detect weak or incorrect configurations that could be exploited.

2. **Assessment and Prioritization.**
   - **Vulnerability Scoring:** Classifies the vulnerabilities found according to their severity, using classification systems such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).
   - **Risk Prioritization:** Helps prioritize the most critical vulnerabilities to be addressed first, based on potential impact and ease of exploitation.

3. **Detailed Reporting.**
   - **Report Generation:** Creates detailed reports that include a description of the vulnerabilities found, their severity level and recommendations for mitigating them.
   - **Alerts and Notifications:** Provides alerts and notifications on newly discovered vulnerabilities or changes in the status of existing ones.

4. **Integration and Automation.**
   - **Integration with Other Systems:** Integrates with other security management tools, such as patch management systems, security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and DevOps platforms.
   - **Scan Automation:** Allows scheduling of automatic scans at regular intervals to ensure continuous assessment of security status.

### Types of Vulnerability Scans.

1. **Network Scans:** 
   - Example:** Nmap, OpenVAS.
   - **Function:** Scan networks to identify connected devices, open ports and running services, looking for vulnerabilities in the network configuration.

2. **Web Application Scanners.**
   - **Example:** Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Acunetix.
   - **Function:** Scan web applications for web application specific vulnerabilities, such as SQL injections, XSS and configuration errors.

3. **Infrastructure Security Scanners:** 
   - **Example:** Nessus, Qualys.
   - **Function:** They assess operating systems, databases and other critical infrastructure for weak configurations, missing patches and other security issues.

### Importance of Vulnerability Scanners

- **Proactive Protection:** Helps identify and correct vulnerabilities before they are exploited by attackers.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Assist in complying with security regulations and industry standards that require regular vulnerability assessments.
- **Risk Management:** Enable organizations to better manage their security risks by providing a clear view of their weaknesses and how to mitigate them.

### Example of Using a Vulnerability Scanner

1. **Configuration:** You configure the scanner to target the specific network or applications you wish to assess.
2. **Scan Execution:** The scan is executed, where the tool analyzes the target for vulnerabilities.
3. **Results Analysis:** The scan results are analyzed to identify the vulnerabilities found.
4. **Implementation of Mitigations:** The recommendations provided by the scan are implemented to mitigate the vulnerabilities detected.
5. **Re-Assessment:** Subsequent scans are performed to ensure that the vulnerabilities have been effectively mitigated and to detect new vulnerabilities.

In summary, vulnerability scanners are an essential tool in the arsenal of any security professional, providing an efficient and effective way to identify and manage vulnerabilities in systems, applications and networks.
