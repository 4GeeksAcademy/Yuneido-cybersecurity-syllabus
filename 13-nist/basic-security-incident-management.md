A security incident, or security event, is any digital or physical breach that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an organization's information systems or confidential data. Security incidents range from intentional cyberattacks carried out by hackers or unauthorized users to unintentional violations of security policy by legitimate authorized users.

Some of the most common security incidents include:

- **DDoS Attacks**: In a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, hackers gain remote control of many computers and use them to overload an organization's network or servers with traffic, preventing those resources from being available to legitimate users.
- **Internal Threats**: There are two types of internal threats. Malicious insiders are employees, partners, or other authorized users who deliberately compromise an organization's information security. Negligent insiders are authorized users who unintentionally compromise security because they do not follow security best practices; for example, using weak passwords or storing confidential data in insecure locations.

**Incident Response**

Incident response (sometimes called cybersecurity incident response) refers to an organization's processes and technologies to detect and respond to cyber threats, security breaches, or cyberattacks. The goal of incident response is to prevent cyberattacks before they occur and minimize the cost and business disruption associated with cyberattacks that do occur.

### Incident Response Plan (IRP) in Cybersecurity

Ideally, an organization defines incident response processes and technologies in a formal Incident Response Plan (IRP) that specifies exactly how different types of cyberattacks should be identified, contained, and resolved. An efficient incident response plan helps cybersecurity teams detect and contains cyber threats, accelerate the restoration of affected systems, and reduce revenue loss, regulatory fines, and other costs associated with these threats. IBM's 2022 Data Breach Costs report concluded that organizations with incident response teams and periodically tested response plans had an average cost per data breach of $2.66 million lower than organizations without incident response teams or plans.

Typically, these plans are developed and executed by a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), consisting of stakeholders from across the organization: the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Security Operations Center (SOC), IT staff, as well as representatives from the executive team, legal, human resources, regulatory compliance, and risk management.

**An incident response plan typically includes:**

- Roles and responsibilities of each CSIRT member.
- Security solutions (software, hardware, and other technologies) to be deployed throughout the enterprise.
- A business continuity plan describing procedures to restore affected critical systems and data as quickly as possible in case of a disruption.
- A detailed incident response methodology outlining specific steps to be taken in each phase of the incident response process (see below), and who should perform them.
- A communications plan to inform company leaders, employees, customers, and even law enforcement about incidents.
- Instructions on how to document and collect information and document incidents for later review and (if necessary) legal proceedings.

**Exercise** - Create an action plan for incident response:

A good methodology is provided by the **NIST framework,** which is a framework for understanding and improving security risks in a company.

It consists of 5 steps:

1. Identify the vulnerability or risk.
2. Protect all valuable documents.
3. Detect any threats that may exist in the system.
4. Implement the action plan to respond to such a threat.
5. Recover the system in case it has been affected in the shortest time possible.
