# Cybersecurity Syllabus

Cybersecurity professionals are in high demand, and the shortage of skilled workers in the field means that qualified candidates are often quickly hired. The skills gap in cybersecurity can work to your advantage, especially if you're willing to continue learning and advancing your skills after the bootcamp.

## Requirements

- You don't need any previous knowledge, but completing the prework material is required.
- Computer 4 cores, eight threads. 8gm RAM. 50 GB hard drive. Your CPU must support virtualization.
- PC Computers with windows, linux, or Intel-Based MacOS.
> Warning: Computers with CPU M1, M2, or M3 are incompatible.

## Outcomes

- Foundational Cybersecurity Knowledge: Understand basic to advanced cybersecurity concepts, including network structures, Linux operations, and server administration.
- Practical Technical Skills: Acquire hands-on skills in navigating and securing Linux and Windows environments, managing servers, and implementing network security measures.
- Cloud Computing Security: Gain insights into cloud environments and understand the security challenges and strategies for IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.
- Penetration Testing Expertise: Develop offensive (Red Team) and defensive (Blue Team) penetration testing skills to identify, exploit, and protect against vulnerabilities.
- Cyber Intelligence Application: Learn to gather and analyze open-source intelligence (OSINT) for cyber threat prevention and mitigation.
- Comprehensive Risk Management: Understand and apply principles of Data Loss Prevention (DLP), risk management, and compliance with international standards like ISO 27001 and NIST.
- Regulatory Compliance and Standards: Become familiar with critical cybersecurity frameworks and regulations, including the National Security Scheme (ENS), to ensure the protection of information systems in various sectors.

## Career Outcomes

- Portfolio Development The bootcamp covers a broad range of topics from basic networking fundamentals to advanced penetration testing, cloud security, and compliance standards. This breadth of knowledge is crucial for entry-level positions in cybersecurity.
- **Hands-On Experience:** We will emphasize practical, hands-on experience, which is highly valued by employers. Demonstrating that you've applied your learning in real-world scenarios can will make you an attractive candidate.
- **Portfolio Development:** You'll complete projects that demonstrate your skills in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities, among other things. A portfolio of such projects is a strong addition to your resume.

## Aditional notes

- The pentesting practices are based on the laboratories of the EJPT certification.
- No bootcamp in the world leaves you ready to certify in anything (EJPT, CEH, etc.), but if you wish to get certified after the bootcamp, you will have a large part of the study already done.
