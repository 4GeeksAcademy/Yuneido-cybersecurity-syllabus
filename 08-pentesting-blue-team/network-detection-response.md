## What is Network Detection and Response (NDR)?

Network Detection and Response (NDR) is a cybersecurity solution that ingests network traffic and uses machine learning to detect malicious activity and understand security risks and exposure. It combines detection of known attack behaviors with the ability to understand what is normal for a given organization, signaling unusual changes that may indicate an attack.

Like endpoint detection and response (EDR), NDR security solutions do not prevent malicious activity. Instead, their goal is to stop ongoing attack activity before it can be harmful. NDR differs from EDR in that it does not use an agent to obtain information about malicious activity, but relies on a network or virtual tap for traffic analysis between on-premises and cloud workloads.

## Capabilities of NDR solutions

NDR solutions analyze network traffic to detect malicious activity inside the perimeter (also known as the east-west corridor) and support intelligent threat detection, investigation, and response. Using an out-of-band network mirror port or virtual tap, NDR solutions passively capture network communications and apply advanced techniques, including behavioral analysis and machine learning, to identify known and unknown attack patterns. This data can also be used to conduct real-time investigations into post-compromise activity and to forensically investigate incidents. While not all NDR solutions decrypt network traffic, the most advanced solutions provide secure decryption capabilities to help identify threats hiding within encrypted traffic.

### The need for an NDR solution

Most cyberattacks occur over the network, which is both good and bad for defenders. On the one hand, network attacks can be detected and mitigated by network-level defenses. On the other hand, the complexity and scale of the average organization's network and the increasing sophistication of cyber threat actors can make it difficult to detect attacks from legitimate traffic.

Deep network visibility and advanced threat detection and prevention capabilities are essential to protect the enterprise against cyber threats. Traditional signature-based detection methods are often ineffective against modern threats, leaving the organization with a false sense of security. NDR security solutions provide an additional layer of network-level security and threat prevention capabilities that organizations require.

### How does NDR work?

NDR solutions should be able to monitor traffic flows from north to south and east to west with strategically placed sensors. This provides deep network visibility that supports other features of an NDR solution, including:

- **Cyber incident detection:** NDR solutions go beyond signature-based detection to use artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data analytics to analyze network traffic. This enables them to detect patterns and identify anomalies in network traffic, allowing them to detect suspicious or malicious traffic.
- **Investigation:** NDR security solutions monitor network traffic and extract patterns that can signal anomalous or suspicious connections. This information is used to generate automated responses by the NDR solution and is provided to Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts to facilitate their incident investigation activities.
- **Intelligence management:** Network detection and response solutions can consume threat intelligence from both inside and outside the organization. This intelligence is used to help detect potential threats within network traffic and can be shared with other security solutions as part of a converged security architecture.
- **Feed creation:** The primary function of an NDR solution is to provide SOC analysts with information about the current security posture and threats to your network. NDR will create a feed of security alerts indicating suspicious and potentially malicious network traffic.
- **Threat prevention:** In addition to alerting security analysts to potential threats, NDR solutions can also act automatically and proactively to prevent cyber-attacks from succeeding. This can include working with firewalls and other security solutions to prevent suspicious or bad traffic from reaching its destination, disrupting the attack.

### How does NDR improve your security?

Traditional network security solutions typically focus on detection and use signature-based detection capabilities. Both are passive when it comes to protecting the enterprise against modern cyber threats. Signature-based detection schemes used in many legacy security solutions, such as traditional antivirus and intrusion detection systems (IDS), are no longer effective in detecting modern threats.

Cybercriminals often use malware designed to differ from campaign to campaign, which means signatures become obsolete as soon as they are generated. An NDR solution uses advanced AI detection capabilities to identify and respond to even novel cyber threats for which signatures do not yet exist.

NDR provides visibility into the enterprise network, enabling analysts to determine affected assets and correlate their anomalous behavior, generating indicators of attackers' tactics, techniques, and procedures. The indicators are used to disrupt and contain attacks and to guide damage assessment and recovery operations.
