## **INSTALLATION OF METASPLOITABLE 2**

Metasploitable is an operating system designed to be easily exploited to conduct penetration tests and enhance security to prevent short, medium, or long-term attacks.

## **What is Metasploitable**

It is a Linux system developed with high-security vulnerabilities where we can carry out all the necessary tests to perfect security techniques or understand how to maximize the use of applications designed for this purpose. Metasploitable does not have a graphical environment and is recommended for use exclusively in private networks due to its vulnerability to attacks. It is open source and allows vulnerability testing in embedded files, file attributes, permissions, etc. Next, we will see how to install Metasploitable on VirtualBox to perform various tests according to each one's needs.

**Prerequisites**

For this, you will need the following:

- [VIRTUALBOX](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/)

To start the process, create the virtual machine in VirtualBox by clicking on the **New** icon at the top and entering the following values in the displayed window:

Click **Next**, and in the next window, you can leave the RAM value as default, 2048MB, or assign a bit more if desired.

Click **Next**, and in the next window, select the option **Create a virtual hard disk now:**

![Crear disco duro](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/crear-disco-duro.png?raw=true)

Here is the translation to English:

Click on **Next** and then Finish.

![Terminar](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/terminar.png?raw=true)

Now, click on the **Start** button to begin the system installation process.

![Iniciar sistema](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/iniciar-sistema.png?raw=true)

This process takes around 5 minutes, and you will see the following:

![Iniciar sistema2](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/iniciar-sistema2.png?raw=true)

The access credentials are:

- **Username: msfadmin**
- **Password: msfadmin**

![Credenciales de acceso](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/credenciales-de-acceso.png?raw=true)

This way, you can use Metasploitable with all the necessary tests.

## **Basic tools needed for pentesting**

Pentesting involves using various tools to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems and networks. Hackers use a variety of tools to analyze the systems they are working on, detect the most vulnerable areas, and prevent potential cybercriminal attacks. It is an essential practice to keep a company's network secure and protect private and sensitive data from unauthorized access.

### **What is a vulnerability scanner**

A **vulnerability scanner** is software designed to perform automated analysis of any application, system, or network to identify possible vulnerabilities. Although these applications cannot detect vulnerabilities with complete accuracy, they can identify certain elements that could lead to vulnerabilities, greatly facilitating the work of researchers and engineers. There are **various types of vulnerability scanners**, authenticated, where tests and potential attacks are performed from within the network, and unauthenticated, where the researcher attempts to simulate an attack from outside to see how far they can go in analyzing (and exploiting) possible vulnerabilities. In the network, we can find a large number of vulnerability scanners, most of them very similar but with some aspects that clearly differentiate them and make them better, or simply different, than others.

### **What features it must have**

These tools are widely used by companies and organizations. This is something they use to detect possible security breaches in systems and networks. But for these to be effective, there are some features they must be able to fulfill. These are:

| Comprehensive Coverage | Vulnerability scanners must be able to detect a wide variety of vulnerabilities. This includes configuration issues, software vulnerabilities, network vulnerabilities, and application vulnerabilities. On the other hand, it must be able to recognize both known vulnerabilities and unknown or new ones. |
| --- | --- |
| Accuracy | The analyzer must have high accuracy in identifying vulnerabilities. This means minimizing false positives and false negatives as much as possible. |
| Scheduled and Automatic Scans | One of the most requested functions is the ability to perform scheduled or automatic scans. This helps maintain a complete and continuous view of the security of systems and networks. Thus, problems can be detected and addressed before they are exploited. |
| Analysis of Reports and Results | The tool must have the ability to create detailed reports showing the results of the scans. These include information about identified vulnerabilities as well as suggestions for solutions. |
| Ease of Use | A good vulnerability scanning system must be easy to use and understand so that the results are clear. Administrators should not encounter difficulties in understanding reports or results. This allows for more effective solutions. |
| Integration | This tool must be able to integrate with other security tools, be it the firewall or antivirus. This will help detect intrusions and provide a more complete view of the security of the entire network. |
