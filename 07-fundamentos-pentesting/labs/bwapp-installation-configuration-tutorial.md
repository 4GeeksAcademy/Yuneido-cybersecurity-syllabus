### bWAPP

This comprehensive tutorial will teach you how to perform penetration testing and check the main web vulnerabilities using the bWAPP tool. Created by Malik Messelem, [bWAPP](http://www.itsecgames.com/) (an abbreviation for "buggy web application") is possibly one of the most well-known free and open-source applications within Hacker Simulators. It is deliberately created with vulnerabilities for practicing and improving ethical hacking skills. Whether you are a cybersecurity enthusiast, a passionate individual, a student, a developer, or a professional just looking to have fun, this environment will help you perform and enhance your ethical hacking and penetration testing skills in an excellent environment. What makes bWAPP unique is that it offers [over a hundred vulnerabilities](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) and web application flaws derived from the well-known OWASP Top Ten Project.

Some of the vulnerabilities include:

- Cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site tracing (XST), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF).
- DoS attacks.
- SQL, HTML, iFrame, SSI, OS Command, PHP, XML, XPath, LDAP, Host Header, SMTP injections, and much more...

bWAPP is built in PHP and uses a MySQL database. It can be hosted on both Windows and Linux operating systems: on Windows, it can be hosted on xampp and wamp servers, and on Linux, Apache. It is also great for use on Kali Linux.

- You can [download bWAPP](http://www.itsecgames.com/download.htm) from its website.
- Project website: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/bwapp/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bwapp/)

It can be hosted on Linux or Windows with Apache or IIS and MySQL. It is supported on WAMP or XAMPP. Another option is to use a virtual machine compatible with VMware or VirtualBox. bWAPP is free and open-source; it can be downloaded in two versions, one for local use and another for installation on a virtual machine. The website is developed in PHP and MySQL, making it cross-platform. Download and install [bWAPP](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bwapp/files/latest/download?source=files) locally; in this case, we will do it on Kali Linux.

Then, go to the location where you downloaded bWAPP, open the file explorer as an administrator, copy the file to /var/www/html, and unzip it, or use the command line:

> unzip bWAPPv2.2.zip -d /var/www/html

After extracting, we will give it permissions.

> chmod -R 777 /var/www/html/bWAPPv2.2

Start Apache and MySQL.

> service apache2 start

> service mysql start

Now, you can go to your browser, enter your machine's IP, or use localhost:

Click "here"!

For Windows, you need to install WampServer [Download wampserver3.3.0_x64.exe (WampServer) (sourceforge.net)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/files/WampServer%203/WampServer%203.0.0/wampserver3.3.0_x64.exe/download)

![wampServer](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wampserver.png?raw=true)

Install and start it; if everything goes well, you will see a new icon in the taskbar.

Now… happy hacking

Here is the translation to English:

## **Bee-Box**

If we want to install the project on a virtual machine, the project is [Bee-Box](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bwapp/files/bee-box/bee-box_v1.6.7z/download). **Bee-Box is a Linux virtual machine with everything pre-installed**. So, we only need to explore all bWAPP vulnerabilities without the risk of defacing the bWAPP website. Additionally, with the virtual machine, we can attempt to gain root access. We will install the Bee-Box version of bWAPP by extracting the downloaded file, creating a folder with many vmdk files on our local server. Next, we will create the virtual machine by assigning a 32-bit Ubuntu Linux version.

![Bee-box2](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/bee-box2.png?raw=true)

Next, we need to select the downloaded file named **bee-box.vdmk**.

![Resumen](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/resumen.png?raw=true)

Before starting the virtual machine, remember to configure the network from **Settings** so that we can have an IP address and access the virtual machine from another computer.

![IP](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/ip.png?raw=true)

Click create and then start to make the virtual machine operational. Once loaded, we will see the desktop.
