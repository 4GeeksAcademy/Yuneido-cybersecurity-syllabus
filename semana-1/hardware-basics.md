To learn more about the basic components of a computer we must first know what a computer is.

A computer is a programmable digital electronic machine that executes a series of commands to process input data, obtaining information that is then sent to the output units. A computer is composed of many different integrated circuits and various support, extension, and accessory elements, which together can execute various tasks very quickly and under the control of a program.

A computer is composed of two basic aspects: the **hardware** which are the parts and components of the computer and the **software** which are all the programs and systems that the computer has.

We can see the hardware as a box where a series of devices and components that process input and output information are connected, while the software is the set of instructions to execute that input and output information. Without the software instructions, the computer would be a box without utility, just as the human body would be without a brain.

## Hardware Parts ðŸ’»

Computer hardware is divided into: **Internal Hardware** and **External Hardware.** Below we will explain each of them and how they are composed.

### Internal hardware:

- **Baseboard or Motherboard**.

It is the main board of any computer system to which all other devices are connected, both directly (such as interconnected electrical circuits) and indirectly (through USB ports or other types of connectors). It has a basic software called BIOS that allows it to perform and synchronize its basic functions (such as data transmission, power management and recognition of the physical connection of other external components).

- **Processor**.

This is the Central Processing Unit (**CPU**), i.e. the brain of the computer, that controls everything that runs the computer and is responsible for performing calculations and understanding data. There are several types of CPUs that differ, among other things, in their speed for processing information. This speed is measured in a frequency unit called Hertz (Hz) and the faster the speed achieved by the processor, the faster the computer's performance. Currently, the two main CPU brands are AMD and Intel.

- Internal RAM

It is the memory that stores information, temporarily and quickly, so that the computer can use it at the moment. Its storage capacity is measured in units called *gigabytes *****(**GB**). The larger the amount of RAM, the faster the computer can run. For example, to open and use several programs at once. The contents of the RAM memory are deleted as soon as the computer is turned off because it does not store data (files, videos, programs, etc.), but retains information about the actions being performed with that data. It does not store the file or the program itself, but the information to execute it.

The RAMs can be DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5 and will depend on the type of RAM slots or ports that the motherboard has.

- Internal Memory ROM

It is the memory that stores information permanently and is called "read-only", that is, the user cannot alter the content once the information is stored, it can only be installed or uninstalled. ROM memory stores everything related to instructions or what is also called **BIOS** (basic system or boot program), which includes instructions on how to start the machine or how programs work, among others.

- Graphics processing unit (GPU)**.

Also known as **graphics card** or **video card** is an internal hardware device that connects to the motherboard and allows the computer to display images on the monitor.  There are two types of GPUs:

1. **Integrated GPU - T**also called "integrated graphics", refers to the fact that the CPU and graphics card share the same random access memory. This means that all the tasks to be executed in the system, together with those of a graphical nature, are supported by the same RAM.
2. **Dedicated graphics cards -** Also called "discrete", are those that have a separate RAM that is exclusively used by the GPU. This memory is called VRAM, and the more memory the video card has, the more visual tasks it can run at the same time.

- **Sound card**.

It is an internal hardware device that connects to the motherboard and is classified according to the channels it uses. For example: stereo, quadraphonic (surround sound), and MIDI (professional use connector), among others. The main function of the board is to allow the computer to reproduce sounds through speakers or headphones. It also receives sounds from the user through the connection of a microphone.

- Secondary storage device

It is the memory that stores data permanently (or until the user deletes it), such as documents, spreadsheets, images, videos, audios, backups of files, among others. These are stored data that the computer does not need immediately or quickly for its operation, but are used directly by the user. There are two types of secondary storage devices: internal (the hard disk drive) and external (external hard disk, memory card, pen drive, CD-ROM, etc.).

### External hardware:

- **Input devices**

They are parts that receive raw data and that the computer can process through its software. They are divided into two categories:

1. manual input devices that must be operated by the user (keyboard, mouse, touch screen, touch screen, microphone, etc.) and 2.
2. Automatic input devices, which trigger the input of information on their own, independent of the user (magnetic stripe reader, PIN and chip reader, bar code reader, etc.).

- Output devices

These are parts that send out the data processed by the computer. There are two types: **temporary output** such as the monitor, which constantly updates the output image on the screen, and **permanent output** such as a printer, which reproduces information on a piece of paper that lasts as a hard copy.

- Storage devices

These are devices that allow the recording of information that is generally found in RAM, and that both the user and the operating system have at their disposal for their daily work and operation. We can consider this type of storage as non-volatile, that is, both programs and data do not disappear, even when the computer is turned off. This means that the user can save his programs and information with the certainty that they will not be deleted even when the computer is not turned on.

Currently, there are several devices used for computer data storage, among them, we have:

1. **Hard Disk:**

A **hard disk** is a non-volatile data storage device that uses a magnetic recording system to store digital data quickly and securely. That is, only two values represented by 0 and 1 as binary code are used to store data. A *bit* is the minimum and elementary unit used to store information on hard disks. As it is a very small unit, the byte is usually used, which is equivalent to 8 bits.

Physically, a hard disk is composed of one or more rigid disks (also known as platters) generally made of aluminum and covered with a layer of magnetizable material, joined by a single shaft that rotates at high speed inside a sealed metal box. On each platter, and each of its faces, there is a read/write head that floats on a thin sheet of air generated by the rotation of the disks. In a magnetic hard disk, the information is stored in disk sectors in binary format organized by blocks. Therefore, bytes are used as the basic unit of information storage together with a quantity prefix. It has been established as a general agreement to use a **b** to indicate bits, and a **B** to indicate bytes.

Among the hard disks we can get:

**1.1** Hard Disk Drive (HDD) 3.5" model, with SATA connection format and a data transmission speed close to 80 MB/s in read operations and 60 MB/s in write operations.

**1.2** Solid State Drive (SSD) 2.5" model, with SATA connection format and a data transmission speed close to 250 MB/s in read and 230 MB/s in write operations.

**1.3** M.2 Solid State Drive, compact 22mm models, with a connection format using the PCIe 4.0 bus, with a transmission speed of up to 10 Gbps.

2. **Flash Memory:**

Flash storage is a data storage technology based on high-speed electrically programmable memory. The speed of flash storage is what gave it its name: it writes data and performs random input and output operations at the speed of flash.

Flash storage uses a type of non-volatile memory called "**flash memory**." Non-volatile memory does not require power to maintain the integrity of stored data, so if the power supply is interrupted, nothing is lost. In other words, non-volatile memory does not forget the data it has stored when the disk is disconnected.

We commonly find flash storage devices in USB (Universal Serial Bus) drives, and today we have different USB formats:

- USB 2.0 with speeds between 240 MB/s to 480 MB/s, recognizable by their black color.
- USB 3.0 ready to achieve 640 MB/s, recognizable by their blue color.

3. **Peripheral devices**

It is an independent device, connected externally or internally to the motherboard, that allows the computer system to perform an extra function. As such, it is not part of the central process of a computer, but rather serves as a complement to increase its functional capabilities.

![External Hardware](../assets/hardware-externo.png)

There are 5 types of computer peripherals:

| Input Peripherals | These allow the entry of data from the external environment. Examples: mouse, keyboard, microphone, and scanner. |
| --- | --- |
| Output Peripherals | Project information from inside a computer system to the external environment. The projected information is generally in auditory, visual, or printed format. Examples: screen, printer, speakers, and graphics card. |
| Input/Output (I/O) Peripherals | Devices that can both receive and transmit information. Unlike input or output peripherals, I/O devices can perform both functions (reception and emission), not limiting themselves to just one. Examples: touch screen, multifunction printer, virtual reality headset, and modem. |
| Communication Peripherals | Physical elements that enable the connection between two or more devices. Examples: network card, USB hub, modem, fax, and network switch. |

## Computer Architecture

Computer architecture refers to a series of related ideas within the fields of computer science and technology. On the **software** level, it refers to assembly language systems that connect various parts of computer hardware into a single operating system. Concerning **hardware**, it applies equally to the methods of creating and using hardware and the process of building computer components. Each of these definitions describes a similar processâ€”the idea of starting with a non-functional computer system and making it functionalâ€”but all look at the process from a different perspective. In other words, the concept of computer architecture refers to the integration of its physical structure with its logical structure.

Computer architecture is crucial as it determines how a computer will operate and what it can be used for. It influences the performance, power consumption, size, and cost of the computer.

A computer architecture can be a combination of both hardware and software or just one of the two. Hardware architecture is the implementation of a computer's logic, while software architecture is the implementation of a computer's functionality. However, software architecture heavily depends on hardware architecture.

### Computer Architecture and Software Architecture

The terms computer architecture and software architecture are not the same and have entirely different meanings. While computer architecture is the logic directing a physical device, software architecture is the logic directing a device's functionality.

Among the main components of the architecture, we have

1. CPU or processor.
2. Bus.
3. Main memory (RAM).
4. Input and output system.

> ðŸ‘‰ There are different types of data architecture, including:

| Data Flow Architecture | It is a parallel architecture in which data passes through different calculation stages. In this architecture, the result of one calculation is used as input for another calculation. |
| --- | --- |
| von Neumann Architecture | The von Neumann architecture is a sequential architecture in which calculations are executed sequentially. The calculation is performed in sequential order. This architecture has a central processing unit (CPU), memory, and input-output devices. |
| Harvard Architecture | This architecture is a modified version of the von Neumann architecture. It has two separate memories: one for program instructions and another for data. |
| Modified Harvard Architecture | It is a combination of data flow architecture and Harvard architecture. In this architecture, there is a program memory and a data memory. |

### ðŸ’ª **Exercise**

Make a list of the features of the PC you would like to build. Not all motherboards are compatible with all processors, so research which motherboard is ideal for the processor you would like to have, the amount of RAM, the type of storage disk, and if the architecture also includes a graphics card.
