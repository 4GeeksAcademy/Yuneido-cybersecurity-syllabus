Network security is any activity designed to protect the access, use, and integrity of network and corporate data.

- It includes hardware and software technologies.
- It is aimed at various threats.
- It prevents them from entering or spreading through the network.
- Effective network security manages network access.

## How Does Network Security Work?

Network security combines multiple layers of defense at the perimeter and within the network. Each network security layer implements policies and controls. Authorized users gain access to network resources, while malicious users are blocked from exploiting vulnerabilities and threatening security.

## How Does Network Security Benefit Me?

Digitalization has transformed the world. It has changed the way we live, work, learn, and entertain ourselves. All organizations that want to provide the services that customers and employees demand must protect their network. Network security also helps protect confidential information from attacks. Ultimately, it protects your reputation.

## Types of Network Security

### Firewalls

Firewalls create a barrier between your trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the Internet. They use a defined set of rules to allow or block traffic. A firewall can be hardware, software, or both.

### Email Security

Email gateways are the primary threat vector for security breaches. Attackers use personal information and social engineering tactics to craft sophisticated phishing campaigns aimed at device recipients to direct them to malware sites. An email security application blocks incoming attacks and controls outbound messages to prevent the loss of sensitive data.

### Antivirus and Antimalware Software

"Malware," short for "malicious software," includes viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware. In some cases, malware can infect a network and remain dormant for days or even weeks. The best antimalware programs not only detect malware upon entry but also continuously track files to detect anomalies, remove malware, and fix damage.

### Network Segmentation

Software-defined segmentation categorizes network traffic into different classifications and makes enforcing security policies easier. Ideally, classifications are based on EndPoint identity, not just IP addresses. You can assign access rights based on roles, locations, and other criteria to give the right level of access to the right people and contain and remediate suspicious devices.

### Access Control

Not all users should have access to the network. To prevent potential attacks, you must recognize all users and devices. Then you can enforce security policies. You can block non-compliant EndPoint devices or provide them with limited access. This process is called network access control (NAC).

### Application Security

Any software you use to run your business must be protected, whether your IT staff builds it or you buy it. Unfortunately, all applications can have vulnerabilities that attackers can use to infiltrate the network. Application security encompasses the hardware, software, and processes used to fix these vulnerabilities.

### Behavioral Analytics

To detect abnormal network behavior, you must first understand normal behavior. Behavioral analytics tools automatically detect activities that deviate from the norm. The security team can then better identify infiltration indicators that might pose problems and quickly respond to threats.

### Data Loss Prevention

Organizations must ensure that staff do not send sensitive information outside the network. Data loss prevention (DLP) technologies can prevent people from uploading, forwarding, or even printing critical information insecurely.

### Intrusion Prevention Systems

An intrusion prevention system (IPS) analyzes network traffic to actively block attacks. IPS devices achieve this by correlating vast amounts of global threat intelligence to block malicious activity and monitor the progress of suspicious files and malware across the network to prevent outbreaks and reinfection.

### Mobile Device Security

Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting mobile devices and applications. Within the next three years, 90 percent of IT organizations will have corporate mobile applications. You must control which devices can access your network. You must also configure connections to preserve network traffic privacy.

### Security Information and Event Management

SIEM products gather the information that security staff needs to identify and respond to threats. These products come in different forms, including virtual and physical appliances and server software.

### VPN

A virtual private network encrypts the connection from an endpoint to the network, usually over the Internet. Typically, a remote access VPN uses IPsec or a secure sockets layer to authenticate communications between devices and the network.

### Web Security

A web security solution controls employee web use, blocks web-based threats, and restricts access to malicious websites. It protects the web gateway on-site or in the cloud. "Web security" also refers to the steps you take to protect your website.

### Wireless Security

Wireless networks are not as secure as wired networks. Without strict security measures, installing a wireless LAN is like putting Ethernet ports everywhere, including the parking lot. To prevent an attack, you need products specifically designed to protect the wireless network.
