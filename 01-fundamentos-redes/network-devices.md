Network devices are tools that allow electronic devices to communicate with each other, like when you use the internet on your computer or phone. Here I explain some of the most common network devices in simple language:

1. **Router**: This is like the brain of your home network. It decides how data travels between your home and the outside world, such as the internet. It also assigns addresses to your devices so they know where to send and receive information.
2. **Modem**: This device connects your home to the Internet. It takes the internet signal coming from outside and converts it into something your devices can understand. Think of it as a translator.
3. **Switch**: Imagine a switch as a power strip for your devices. You connect various network cables to it so that devices can communicate with each other within your local network, such as your computers, printers, and more.
4. **Access Point**: This device allows wireless devices, such as your phone or laptop, to connect to the network. It creates a "Wi-Fi zone" to move freely without wires.
5. **Firewall**: A firewall is like a security guard for your network. It protects your devices by blocking threats and controlling who can enter or leave your network.
6. **Signal Repeater (Range Extender)**: If your Wi-Fi doesn't reach every corner of your home, a signal repeater can help. It takes the existing Wi-Fi signal and amplifies it to cover larger areas.
7. **Combined Modem-Router (Gateway)**: Some devices act as a modem and routers in one. They are convenient if you don't want two separate devices.
8. **Server**: You can think of a server as a powerful computer that stores important information or applications. In enterprise networks, servers are essential for sharing data and applications among many users.
9. **End Devices**: These are your devices, such as your computer, phone, tablet, printer, etc. They connect to the network to access the internet and share information.

### ðŸ’¡Lab: Design a LAN Network

With all the above mentioned download the free software from Cisco called Cisco Packet Tracer and solve the following challenge:

You are a network administrator hired by 4Geeks Academy. On your first day of work, the head of security and communications assigns you to design a LAN network connecting the 8 computers that make up the education department's network and deliver a budget estimate on the total cost of the network installation. To solve this challenge you must:

1. Download Cisco's free software: Cisco Packet Tracer, with this program you will be able to design a LAN network visually.
2. Research the prices and features of the network devices you will need to design your LAN and prepare a quotation.
3. Produce a technical report in which you explain the LAN design 2.

> ðŸ’¡Hints: Choose the network topology you deem appropriate (There are no wrong answers), remember that it is not necessary to use all the network devices seen during your learning and that sometimes less is more. In your technical report, explain your choices and why this is the most optimal way to create a LAN.
