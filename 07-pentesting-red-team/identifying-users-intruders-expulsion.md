### How to expel your intruder from your network with Kali Linux?

The other day I was wondering about how to expel your intruder from your network we can also change the password of our network but if you want to use it for something else it can also be useful. Our method is to leave the Internet to our intruder, the tool is called “ KickThemOut”.

### What is KickThemOut?

A tool to kick devices out of your network and enjoy all the bandwidth for you. It allows you to select specific devices or all ARP and spoofs from your local area network. Compatible with Python 2.6 & 2.7 and allows you to select specific devices on the network or all connected devices. We can see their [github for more information](https://github.com/k4m4/kickthemout).

Here is the corrected format in English:

**Installation**

| Step | Command |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | sudo apt-get update |

> We will also need to have Nmap installed. If we don't have it, we can install it in Debian with the command:

| Step | Command |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | sudo apt-get install nmap |

> With everything installed and updated, it's time to download the application. For this, we place it where we want to download it, and we clone it from its GitHub repository with the command:

| Step | Command |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | git clone https://github.com/k4m4/kickthemout.git |

> We access the downloaded folder and install the application:

| Step | Command |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | cd kickthemout/ |
| 2 | sudo python -m pip install -r requirements.txt |

> Now it's time to run and test the application:

| Step | Command |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | python kickthemout.py |

![Termina1](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/terminal1.png?raw=true)

So we run the code and it asks us for 3 options.

1. Option to leave the Internet to a single user.
2. To leave without Internet to one or more selected users.
3. We leave without the Internet at all (TOTAL EVIL).

The operation is very simple, it is only to introduce the number of the operation that we want to carry out to carry out it. We can see an example that I have stopped in the middle, only to show the operation.

### Can routers be hacked?

If your computer is hacked, the dangers are clear: a hacker can access all your confidential personal files and even delete them if you wish. Once a hacker has gained access to your PC or their phone, they can install malware to spy on your Internet activity, hijack your files via ransomware, or cause other damage. Unfortunately, **routers are also vulnerable**.

### What is the danger of a hacked router?

The danger when a router is hacked is that it can initiate a whole new set of threats, from the seemingly innocent to the much more serious. With that level of access, someone who has hacked your router can:

- **Saturate your bandwidth:** This is more annoying than harmful, but still, if someone is using your Wi-Fi connection for game or movie streaming (or even cryptomining), they will have little bandwidth left for their activities.
- **Spy on your Internet traffic:** Someone who has accessed your Wi-Fi network can spy on all network traffic on any device that is connected. This includes your PC, your phone, your family's PCs and phones, your game console, your smart home devices, and more. Hackers can also use a packet sniffer to monitor Internet traffic in real time and capture all incoming and outgoing data.
- **Accessing illegal content:** You may have a spotless Internet history, but the person hacking your Wi-Fi may not. They can use your Internet connection to view or upload illegal media, stream or download hacked content, shop on the dark web, and many other dubious actions, all in your name.
- **Collect your personal data:** Router hackers can capture any data you enter on a web page with an unencrypted connection, i.e. any web page that only uses HTTP. And the same goes for anyone connected to your hacked Wi-Fi network. Never enter sensitive data, such as passwords, on a web page that does not have HTTPS encryption.
- **Install malware:** Yes, there is router malware. A hacker with access to the router can hack the router's firmware to load malware which opens the door to more attacks and spying in the future.
- **Create a map of your Wi-Fi network:** People accessing your router can see all the devices on the network and use that information to plan further attacks. Attacks on routers in smart homes and other Internet of Things devices can be especially dangerous, as not many people pay the same attention to IoT security as they do to their PC security, and phone.
- **Attacking others:** Cybercriminals can hack the router and use it as part of a massive DDOS attack.
- **Changing DNS settings:** A common target of hacked Wi-Fi routers is to access the router's DNS settings, which determine where Internet traffic is sent. Hackers can change the router's DNS settings to redirect Internet traffic to websites they determine, usually, pharming websites that trick you into providing your personal data or malicious websites that download malware onto your devices.

### Have my router been hacked?

Hopefully, you have already followed the above tips to keep your Wi-Fi router free from hacks now and in the future. However, if you suspect that your Wi-Fi router has been hacked or are concerned about these threats, keep an eye out for these signs that may indicate a hack.

- **The Internet is much slower.** This can be due to many reasons, so if you don't notice other symptoms on this list, you don't necessarily need to be concerned. However, slow Internet *yes* can be caused by a Wi-Fi hacker consuming all your bandwidth.
- **There are unknown devices on the router.** If you are using a Wi-Fi network security tool, such as Avast Free Antivirus, it will automatically know if a foreign device is connected to the network. Otherwise, you will need to log into the router and check the list of IP addresses on the network. Cross-reference that list with the IP addresses of your devices (see here how to find out their IP address) to see if there are any foreign elements.
- **DNS settings have changed.** Your router probably connects to a DNS server from your Internet provider, but hackers can change the router's DNS settings so that it uses a malicious server instead. This operation can cause web traffic to be redirected to dangerous web pages to steal your personal data or download malware to the device. You can check the DNS settings of the router in the router administration menu.
- **The router's administration credentials or password have changed**. A hacker who does not try to stay hidden could change the router's password, which would prevent you from using the Internet services you are paying for. You can also block your access to the router's backend by changing the administration credentials.
- **There is unknown software (or malware) on the devices**. This is an important red flag. A hacker with access to the router can infect your devices with all kinds of malware, including ransomware.

> If you experience one or more of these problems, read on to learn how to stop hackers from using your Wi-Fi network and how to regain control of your router.

### How to fix a hacked router

If your router has been hacked, the good news is that you can probably regain control. If you follow the simple procedure we explain below, you should be able to kick any invaders out of your router and prevent future attacks.

There's more good news: If the router is infected with malware, this procedure should also remove it.

1. **Disconnect the router**

You must isolate the router to remedy hacks. The first step is to disconnect all Internet cables from the router. This will immediately sever the connection between the hackers and the devices on the home Wi-Fi network. If there are devices physically connected to the router, disconnect them as well.

2. **Reset the router**

Next, reset the router to factory defaults. Note that this operation is *not* the same as turning the router off and on to try to fix a slow Internet connection.

**Factory resetting erases all data on the router, including any network settings you have configured**. If a hacker knows the administration password, they will not be able to use it after a reset. Resetting the router can also remove some types of malware on the router, including the notorious [VPNFilter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VPNFilter).

Most routers have a factory reset button. You may need a paper clip to press it. If you can't figure out how to reset the router to factory defaults, consult the router manufacturer's user manual or web site.

3. **Log in to the router and change the administration credentials**

Once you have reset the router to factory defaults, you can log in with the default username and password. You will find this information on the router itself, in the user manual, or on the manufacturer's website.

After logging in, change the administration password to a custom password. This will prevent hackers from reconnecting.

4. **Set a new SSID and password for the Wi-Fi network**

Give the wireless network a new name and remember that long and complex names make it more difficult to crack the network. The same goes for the password: use at least 15 characters and a combination of letters, digits, and symbols (or use this tool to create random, impenetrable passwords).

5. **Set up a guest network (optional)**

While configuring the router, consider setting up a guest Wi-Fi network on the router. This is an additional network that allows connected devices to access the Internet without using the main network. That way, if a friend's phone is infected with malware, your new, pristine PC won't be at risk.

If you have a lot of smart devices, you can also direct them to the guest network. IoT devices are generally not very secure, so it's a good idea to isolate them on a separate network.

6. **Update router firmware**

Most routers do not update the firmware automatically, so you will need to do so when you log in. Find the firmware settings in the router's administration menu and update it to the most current version. Attempts to attack the old firmware will be ineffective against the new update.
