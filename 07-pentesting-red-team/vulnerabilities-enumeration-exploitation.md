## Web Enumeration with WPScan

WPScan was first released in 2011, it has survived time and stood out as a vital tool that every pentester should have in their toolbox.

WPScan can list and investigate some categories of security vulnerabilities present in WordPress sites such as:

- Sensitive information disclosure (plugin and theme installation versions for disclosed vulnerabilities or CVE).
- Path discovery (looking for misconfigured file permissions)
- Weak password policies (brute force passwords)
- Presence of default installation (looking for default files)
- Testing of web application firewalls (common WAF plugins)

### Installation

Fortunately, WPScan is pre-installed in the latest Kali Linux and Parrot OS versions. If you are using an older version of Kali, you can simply install it using the following command in your terminal.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install wpscan
```

![WPScan1](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan1.png?raw=true)

If you are using different operating systems and other distributions, you can refer to the [developer](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan#install) documentation and learn how to install it on your machine.

**WPScan database:**

WPScan uses information within a local database as a primary reference point when listing themes and plugins. Before using WPScan, it is strongly recommended that you update this database before performing any scans.

To update your wpscan database, simply run this command on your terminal

```bash
wpscan --update
```

![WPScan2](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan2.png?raw=true)

### Subject Listing

WPS may have a few ways to determine the theme installed on the site. It first uses a technique that we can also do manually. We can look at the assets of the web browser loads and then look for the location of the installed theme on the web server. Using the “Network” tab in your web browser, you can see what files are loaded when you visit that site.

![WPScan3](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan3.png?raw=true)

Above we can see a screenshot where many files have been uploaded and while checking them I found this URL

[http://www.anywordpressintalledsite.com/wp-content/themes/twentynineteen](http://www.anywordpressintalledsite.com/wp-content/themes/twentynineteen)

By looking at this URL we can be sure that the installed theme is twentynineteen. Now let's automate our work, let's use our wpscan to find out which exact theme is running by typing the following command

```bash
wpscan --url http://www.anywordpressintalledsite.com/ --enumerate t
```
And here is the result:

![WPScan4](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan4.png?raw=true)

The great thing about wpscan is that it tells you how it discovered that result.

![WPScan5](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan5.png?raw=true)

### Plugins enumeration:

A very common web server feature is the directory listing, it's like the **ls** command on Linux. It lists the files and directories listed on that web server. “Directory listing” occurs when there is no file present that the web server has been instructed to process. A very common file is “index.html” and “index.php”. Since these files are not present in the /a/ directory, the contents are displayed:

![WPScan6](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan6.png?raw=true)

Wpscan can take advantage of this feature to find out which plugins are installed. Since they will all be located in /wp-content/plugins/pluginname, WPScan can list common/known plugins. We can use the following command to list plugins.

```bash
wpscan --url http://www.anywordpressintalledsite.com/ --enumerate p
```

By reading the WordPress developer documentation, we can learn about the “[read me](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/how-your-readme-txt-works/#how-the-readme-is-parsed)” to discover how WPScan determined the version number. Simply put, plugins must have a “README.txt” file. This file contains meta information such as the name of the plugin, the WordPress versions it is compatible with, and a description.

![WPScan7](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan7.png?raw=true)

### User Enumeration

After reading all this, I think you will realize how powerful this tool is. So, if I tell you that we can also enumerate users using this tool, you won't be surprised. The way WPScan enumerates users is interestingly simple. WordPress sites use authors for posts. Authors are a type of user.

![WPScan8](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan8.png?raw=true)

Let's use our wpscan to scan the users, and how exactly can we do it? simple by following the given command

```bash
wpscan --url http://www.anywordpressintalledsite.com/ --enumerate u
```

![WPScan9](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan9.png?raw=true)

Above, we can see that it found the user, but it says something about brute force. Yes, it can do that too. wpscan can apply brute force using a world list. after that, it says login error? Yes, it tried to login with that username and found out that the user is real.

![WPSca10](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan10.png?raw=true)

**The “Vulnerable” flag:**

So far we have only listed themes, plugins, users, and then we will visit sites like MITRE, NVD, and CVEDetails to look for these plugin names and version numbers to determine any vulnerabilities. Which is quite time consuming and tedious. That's why wpscan has a specific flag to do our job and that flag is -v. To check if any installed plugins are vulnerable or not, we can type this command and find out.

```bash
wpscan --url http://www.anywordpressintalledsite.com/ --enumerate vp
```

Above I said `-v` flag but I typed vp. Did I make a mistake? No, that p stands for plugin, so you can tell wpscan to check the plugins if they are vulnerable or not.

![WPSca11](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan11.png?raw=true)

We got our results in just a few seconds and found that the plugins were not vulnerable.

### Password attack

After determining a list of possible usernames in the WordPress installation, we can use WPScan to perform a brute force technique against the username we specify and a list of passwords we provide. Simply, we use the result of our username enumeration to create a command like this:

```bash
wpscan --url http://www.anywordpressintalledsite.com/ –-passwords rockyou.txt –-usernames Phreakazoid
```

![WPSca12](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan12.png?raw=true)

### WPScan aggressiveness setting (WAF)

Unless specified, WPScan will try to be as “noisy” as possible. Many requests to a web server can trigger things like firewalls and ultimately cause the server to block it.

This means that our WPScan may skip some plugins and themes. Fortunately, we can use arguments like --plugins-detection and an aggressiveness profile (passive/aggressive) to specify this. For example: `--plugins-detection aggressive`.

### Summary - Reference Sheet

- p Enumerate Plugins: `--enumerate p`

- t Enumerate Themes: `--enumerate t`

- u Enumerate Usernames: `--enumerate -u`

- v  check if the plugin is vulnerable:  `--enumerate vp`

- aggressive adjust aggressiveness: `--plugins-detection aggressive`

## Web enumeration using Gobuster

### Manual enumeration

When you start your web enumeration, the best tool to use is your favorite browser. Mine is Firefox, so you can use yours like Chrome, Opera, and Brave is also pretty good. It keeps track of what data it receives and from whom. We can use this for a variety of activities: finding that exact photo or, more usefully, the location of certain files or assets being loaded. This could include things from scripts to page URLs.

### Using our browser developer console

Browsers, including Chrome and Firefox, have a set of tools located under “Developer Tools/Console”. We are going to talk about Firefox, however, Chrome has a very similar suite. This suite includes a range of tools including:

- View page source code.
- Finding assets
- Debugging and executing code as javascript on the client side (our browser)

Using “F12” on our keyboard is a shortcut to launch this suite of tools.

![WPSca13](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan13.png?raw=true)

In the image above you can see the header of the Hello World page and down there you can see that the section “inspector” tool is open. This allows us to see the html source code of the web page. It often contains things like developer comments and the names of certain aspects of web page features, including forms and likes.

Developers often leave comments in the form of **<! - →** tags...for example: <! - This is a comment → which is not displayed in the browser as we can see here:

![WPSca14](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan14.png?raw=true)

## Gobuster

Gobuster is one of the best tools out there for enumerating websites and by web I mean directories, DNS, subdomains, and much more. You can get more information and the source code [here](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster).

**Let's start with how to install Gobuster on Kali Linux:**

You can install gobuster using the following command in your terminal.

```bash
sudo apto install gobuster
```

**Flags**

- t --threads No. of simultaneous threads
- v --verbose Detailed output
- z --no-progress Don't show progress
- q --quiet Do not print banner and noise
- o --output Output file for writing the results

Normally I will change the number of threads to 64 to increase the speed of my scans. If you don't change the number of threads, Gobuster can be a bit slow.

## Gobuster modes

Gobuster is a very powerful and versatile tool. It has different modes to do different things, like dir mode is used when searching for web directories in a web application and dns mode is used when searching for subdomains.

### “dir” mode:

We can guess what this mode does, as its name suggests it is used to force directories in web applications. It is a very powerful tool that not only scans the website but also returns its status code and this will let you know immediately if you, as an external user, can request that directory or not. The additional functionality of Gobuster is that it also allows you to search for files with the addition of a simple flag.

- **Using the dir mode**:

To use dir mode, type the following command.

```bash
gobuster dir
```

This is not the full command but it tells gobuster that the user wants to search for directories on the web. Now, after this, you will have to add the URL and the list of words.

```bash
gobuster dir -u [http://](https://google.com/)10.10.10.10 -w wordlist.txt
```

> **Note**: The URL will be the base path from where Gobuster starts to search. So, the above URL uses the root web directory. For example, in a typical Apache installation on Linux, this is */var/www/html*. ***[Then](http://10.10.10.10/products.)***, If you have a “**products**” directory and you want to list that directory, you should set the URL to *[http://10.10.10.10/productos*.](http://10.10.10.10/products.) You can also think of this as *[http://example.com/path/to/folder*.](http://example.com/path/to/folder.) Note also that I specified the HTTP protocol. This is important and necessary.

**Other useful flags:**

- c --cookies Cookies to be used in requests
- x --extensions File extension(s) to look for
- H --headers Specify HTTP headers, -H 'Header1: val1'
- k --no-tls -validation Skip verification of TLS certificate
- n --no-status Do not print status codes
- P --password Password for basic authentication
- s --status-codes Positive status codes
- b --status-codes-blacklist Negative status codes
- U --username User name for basic authentication

here `-x` or `-` the extension flag is really useful to search for files with a specific extension.

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.10 -w wordlist.txt -x html,php,bak
```

In the above command, we specify to search only for files with extension .html, .php, .bak. The `-k` flag is special because it has an important use during penetration testing and captures flag events. In a flag capture room in TryHackMe, for example, if HTTPS is enabled, you will most likely encounter an invalid certificate error such as the following:

![WPSca15](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan15.png?raw=true)

If you run gobuster on this site without `-k` flag gobuster you will get a long error, so to avoid this kind of invalid certs and give you your results, use `-k` falg in your command.

### “dns” Mode:

The next mode we will focus on is the “dns” mode. This allows Gobuster to brute force subdomains. During a penetration test (or capture the flag), it is important to check the subdomains of your target's main domain. Subdomains increase your scope, so a larger scope has a higher chance of finding a vulnerability.

- **Using “dns” mode:**

You can use the dns mode by typing the following command in your terminal

```bash
gobuster dns
```

As directory mode, this command is incomplete, this will tell gobuster that the user wants to brute force the subdomain, so specify again a domain and a wordlist file.

```bash
gobuster dns -d mydomain.com -w subdomains.txt
```

This command tells gobuster to brute force a subdomain on mydomain.com.

Other useful falgs:

- c --show-cname Show CNAME records (cannot be used with '-i').
- i --show-ips Show IP addresses
- r --resolverUse custom DNS server

### Vhost mode:

The last mode we will focus on is the “vhost” mode. This allows Gobuster to brute force virtual hosts. Virtual hosts are different websites on the same machine. In some cases, they may look like subdomains, but don't be fooled! Virtual hosts are IP-based and run on the same server. This is usually not obvious to the end user. In a compromise, it might be worth running Gobuster in this mode to see if you come up with something - you never know, you might find something! When participating in TryHackMe rooms, virtual hosts would be a good way to hide a completely different website if nothing showed up in the main port 80/443 scan.

**Using vhost mode:**

As dir and dns, you can simply type the following command and run vhost mode in gobuster:

```bash
gobuster vhost
```

This notifies gobuster that the user wants to brute force the virtual hosts at the target URL. After this, you must provide a URL and a wordlist file.

```bash
gobuster vhost -u [http://10.10.10.10](http://10.10.10.10/) -w wordlist.txt
```

**Other useful flags:**

You can see its flag and other documentation in the [official documentation.](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster#vhost-mode-options)

**Kali Linux default wordlists:** **

These are the default word lists that come pre-installed in Kali Linux. I will mention the word lists I use to brute force directories in Kali Linux.

- /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-*.txt
- /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-1.0.txt
- /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt
- /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
- /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/small.txt
- /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/extensions_common.txt: useful for searching files!

`/usr/share/wordlists` has many wordlists for different tasks. You can go there and check them all yourself.

**Non-standard lists:**

In addition to the above, Daniel Miessler has created an amazing GitHub repository called [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists). It compiles many different lists used for many different things. The best part is that it is in apt! You can simply install all those word lists in your Kali using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install seclists
```

In these two word lists, I think you will get all kinds of world lists to do your brute force work.

## Burp Suite: web page enumeration and vulnerability testing

**What is Burp Suite?**

Burp Suite is a comprehensive platform for web application security testing. It can be used for detailed enumeration and analysis of web applications. The tool can simply intercept HTTP/S requests and act as an intermediary between the user and the sites. The necessary details are captured from the website as the user navigates. This information provides information about the security of a web application. *Burp can act as an intermediary by intercepting traffic from your browser to a web page, allowing you to modify and automate changes to web page requests*.

When you open Burp, you are faced with a blank project with a bunch of tabs. Don't worry, we'll cover the essential tabs.

### Setting up the Burp suite

Confirm that the Burp Proxy listener is active.

- Open burp and navigate to the proxy → options tab.
- Verify that the proxy detector is active and set to 127.0.0.1:8080.

**Configure proxy in the web browser**

- For Firefox, navigate to preferences → advanced → network → settings → configuration.
- Enable *manual proxy configuration: verify that it is set to the same proxy as burp (127.0.0.1 on port 8080).

![WPSca16](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan16.png?raw=true)

### Installing the Burp SSL Certificate

- Navigate to [http://burp](http://burp/) and download the certificate by clicking *CA Certificate* on the right.
- Return to the network security settings page in Firefox and click *Certificates*.
- From there, import the certificate you downloaded and check all the boxes.

![WPSca17](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan17.png?raw=true)

### Basic Features

To begin, let's familiarize ourselves with some of the common tabs available in Burp Suite: Intruder, Repeater, and Sequencer.

**Intruder**

With Burp Intruder, you can automate custom attacks against web applications.Customization of attacks requires that we specify one or more payloads and the position where they will be placed on the website.

- Use cases: enumeration of identifiers, collection of payloads, and vulnerability scanning.

**Repeater**.

- The repeater can be used to repeat manually handled individual HTTP requests. This is tremendously useful when testing multiple payloads on the same request. With the repeater, you can test parameters on the same page without doing any additional work with the browser. Issuing requests in a specific sequence becomes much easier, and you can identify how the page reacts to changing parameters at each step.
- Use cases: test a specific set of parameters on the same web page request and reissue requests to manually verify reported problems.

**Sequencer**

- Burp Sequencer can be used to analyze the quality of randomness in a sample of data elements. Ultimately, this means that the sequencer is good for testing data items that should be unpredictable.
- Use cases: testing anti-CSRF tokens or password reset tokens, etc.

### Example of vulnerability exploitation with Burp

Burp Suite gives us additional automation tools to use while testing a web application. To practice attacking vulnerabilities we will use the **[Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)](http://www.dvwa.co.uk/)**. **DVWA** comes preloaded with Metasploitable 2 but can also be downloaded independently and run from a local server. **DVWA** is separated for specific attacks, as seen in its side navigation bar. This allows us to explore common web attacks at different levels of difficulty.

Once **DVWA** is up and running, log in and navigate to the security tab to change the security level to low. This will make the website vulnerable to a wider range of attacks, making it easier to get comfortable with a new tool.

**Brute force on a login page**.

For this example, we will use Burp's Intruder to alter the HTTP request for the login page within **DVWA**.

- Start by logging into **DVWA** using the username "*admin*" and the password "*password*".
- Verify that **DVWA** security is set low for this attack. Higher security levels will prevent this attack from working.
- Navigate to the *Bruteforce* section of the side navigation. Here you will see input boxes for username and password.
- Passing the wrong credentials will result in an error.

![WPSca18](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan18.png?raw=true)

Attempted username: admin and password - 1234, which returned an error. Let's assume we know the username of the user who logged into the site. We can use Burp to intercept requests and try to get a list of passwords on this login page.

It shows that the username and password are passed in the URL.

- Right click on the plain section and *Send to Intruder.
- From the *Intruder → Positions* tab, we can select the parameters we want to modify in our request. From the top, all possible entries are selected. Press the clear button on the right to clear the selections.
- Highlight the password value. In my case, the initial password entered was “1234”. Select that value and press the Add button to the right.

![WPSca19](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan19.png?raw=true)

More selections could be made to change more values in each request.

- The last part of this attack is to add a payload to modify the password value we selected.
- Go to the *Payloads* tab. The payload set will remain as a simple list, and then we will add values to a list for Burp to use in its payload.
- The following image shows the guessed passwords added to the payload for Burp to test. The list of common passwords can be downloaded online for use in more extensive brute force attempts.
- Click *Start attack* to start the attack.

![WPSca20](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan20.png?raw=true)

- A new window should appear showing the Intruder results.

![WPSca21](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan21.png?raw=true)

- How do we know if it worked? Looking at the length tells us that when the payload is “password”, we get a different result than the other submissions. That means we should take a closer look at that value.
- Clicking on the row will bring up additional actions at the bottom of the window.
- Switching to the *Render* tab will show us the result when that specific payload is entered.

![WPSca22](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan22.png?raw=true)

- As you can see, the password worked, and we are shown a valid login page. This can be verified by going to **DVWA** and testing the administrator and password as login values. The same result should appear.

![WPSca23](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/wpscan23.png?raw=true)

Congratulations! You have now completed your first attack using Burp to modify HTTP requests. This is a simple example of how Burp can be used to perform application security testing. There are many more web application attacks. Burp Suite provides additional tools to troubleshoot attacks, either manually or automated. Delving into Burp Suite will reveal just how powerful it can be.

### What's next?

- See additional attack tutorials on the Burp Suite website to familiarize yourself with Burp's role in more intensive attacks.
- Use Burp to perform common web attacks on another vulnerable web application, such as [Mutillidae](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Mutillidae_2_Project) or the [OWASP WebGoat project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebGoat_Project).
- Continue to use Burp in your next web application testing workflow and play with a third-party extension for Burp to add more features.
- Upgrade to the Pro version to check out Burp Suite's vulnerability scanning capabilities. If the price of Pro seems too steep, then OWASP Zap is a free alternative to Burp that allows you to scan for vulnerabilities.

## Nuclei: Automating testing of network services and web applications

Nuclei is an open source framework designed to automate the detection and exploitation of vulnerabilities in web applications and other network services. It allows pentesters and security researchers to define custom templates that specify a set of HTTP requests to send to a target, along with corresponding matching rules that can be used to identify vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

### Installation

To install Nuclei, you can download the latest version from the official [GitHub](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) repository and follow the instructions.

### Tricksheet

Here is a complete cheat sheet with some commonly used Nuclei commands for bug bounty hunting:

1. Show help information.

```bash

```

3. Load a list of targets from a file.

```bash
nuclei -l target.txt -t ~/nuclei-templates/
```

4. Specify a single target for testing

```bash
nuclei -u https://example.com -t ~/nuclei-templates/
```

5. Specify a URL to test

```bash
nuclei -u https://example.com -t ~/nuclei-templates/
```

6. Run nuclei in silent mode (suppress output).

```bash
nuclei -silent -u https://example.com -t ~/nuclei-templates/
```

7. Specify the number of concurrent threads to use.

```bash
nuclei -c 10 -u https://example.com -t ~/nuclei-templates/

```

12. Specify a custom user agent string to include in requests.

```bash
nuclei -user-agent "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3" -u https://example.com -t ~/nuclei-templates/
```

> 👉 These commands should help you get started running Nuclei and customize your tests according to your specific needs. It is important to note that Nuclei supports many more commands and options in addition to these, so be sure to consult the official documentation for more information.

### Templates

To create a template for Nuclei, follow these steps:

1. Choose a target to test, such as a web application or network service.
2. Identify a vulnerability or misconfiguration that you want to test.
3. Use the Nuclei template language to define the test. The template language is based on YAML syntax and supports a wide range of features, such as HTTP requests, response matching, and variables. Refer to the Nuclei documentation for more information about the template language and its features.
4. Save the template in a file with a .yaml extension. It is recommended to save the templates in a folder within the Nuclei template directory for easy management and organization.
5. Test the template by running Nuclei with the `-t` flag and specifying the path to the template file. For example:

```bash
núcleos -t https://example.com -t ~/nuclei-templates/my-template.yaml
```

Analyze the output to determine if the test was successful and if any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations were identified. Make changes to the template as necessary and repeat the testing process until the desired results are achieved.

> *Remember to test your templates carefully and responsibly, and always obtain the target's permission before performing any pentesting.*

### Custom core template SQL injection script with explanations

```bash
id: example-template  # A unique identifier for the template

info:  # Information about the template

  name: Example Template

  author: Your Name

  severity: low

requests:  # List of HTTP requests to send

  - method: GET  # HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)

    path: /  # Request path

    headers:  # Optional request headers

      User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)

matchers:  # List of matchers to apply to the response

  - type: word  # Matcher type (word, status, regex, etc.)

    words: "Example"  # Keyword to search for in the response

attacks:  # Optional list of attack payloads to send

  - payload: "' OR true--"
```

### Explanation

- id: a unique identifier for the template that can be used to reference it in command line arguments and other templates.
- info: metadata about the template, such as the name, author, and severity of vulnerabilities or misconfigurations it tests.
- requests: a list of HTTP requests to send to the destination. This section defines the HTTP method, path, headers, and other attributes of the requests. Requests can be further customized with variables, authentication credentials, and other features.
- matchers: A list of matchers to apply to the request response. The matchers define how to look for specific patterns or keywords in the body or headers of the response. Nuclei supports several types of matchers, such as words, regular expressions, states, and binaries.
- attacks: an optional list of attack payloads for sending requests. These payloads can be used to test for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS and command injection. Nuclei supports several types of payloads, including file-based, parameter-based, and JSON-based payloads.

### Conclusion

Nuclei is a powerful open source tool that automates vulnerability scanning of network services and web applications. Its flexible and customizable approach allows users to create and use templates to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. By using Nuclei with other tools, bug bounty hunters can optimize their testing workflows and improve security. Nuclei's development and community support make it a valuable tool for security testing.
