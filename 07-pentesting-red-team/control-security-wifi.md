Nowadays, most connections are fiber optic with speeds more than enough to cover the most demanding needs of any family. However, when we connect to streaming video platforms or download content, the remaining speed available to other users is considerably reduced. If, in addition, we have an intruder in our network, the speed will be even more reduced and we will have problems when playing streaming content, downloading content or even accessing the Internet.

Fortunately, both **detecting intruders on a WiFi network** and expelling them and preventing them from reconnecting is a very simple and quick process, following the steps below.

### Problems associated with having our WiFi stolen

When we talk about someone stealing our WiFi signal, the first thing that comes to mind is the **speed loss** that our connection will experience, a loss that, depending on the speed we have contracted, can be more or less noticeable, however, it is not the only reason why we should check if we have an intruder in our network, as we can have problems of the most diverse nature.

If we share content through our local network from our PC, if we have an intruder, he will be able to access all that content and, if he has full permissions, he will be able to **delete all the content** as well as download it to his computer. This is especially serious when we share a folder where we store all the documents we use both at work and at school and on a personal level, such as our finances, passwords, and so on.

Any device that connects to the Internet through our connection will leave a trace of our IP. In this way, if any illegal activity takes place, the **responsible** in the face of the public order authorities will be us, although later through the router, it can be verified that it was not really us through the different devices that we use, with the possibility that the authorities may consider that we have disposed of the device used.

If the person who has connected to our network has extensive computer knowledge and his only purpose is not to use our internet signal for free but to steal personal information such as **bank access keys** (a very simple operation using programs that capture and analyze the data circulating on the network) the problem can be much more important than we could imagine at first.

> ðŸ’¡ We also run the risk of running out of internet. Once the intruder gains access to our router, he can easily access the router, especially if it is a generic model and change the password of our WiFi signal by ejecting all the devices we have connected.

## Detect intruders on a WiFi network

In recent years, Microsoft has implemented a large number of functions natively that allow users to perform the same functions for which it was previously necessary to use a third-party application. A clear example is Microsoft Defender, the native Windows antivirus. However, since it is not a common need for most users, although it is not, it does not include the possibility of knowing which are all the devices connected to our network, either via WiFi or through an Ethernet cable.

To detect intruders on a network, we have two options. On the one hand, we can access the router's configuration and, on the other hand, we can use third-party applications. But, firstly, we must know what to look for and how to identify the devices. When a device connects to a router, the router automatically assigns it an IP address that allows it to access the network. That information is stored in a registry, a registry where the MAC address (the device's license plate) and the device name are also stored (although this information is not always able to identify it).

### From the router

The router includes a log where all devices that have connected to the device are stored, including the assigned IP, MAC, and device name. The router access data is located at the bottom of the device. The address to be entered always starts with 192.186 followed by two other numbers. The username and password are also located at the bottom of the router. Some routers, from the main page, show the number of devices connected via WiFi and using an ethernet cable. To know the devices connected via WiFi, just click on **Wi-Fi devices** or **Wi-Fi devices**.

![router1](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/router1.png?raw=true)

The following list will display all devices connected via WiFi. Some devices will be shown with the name they have configured, but not all. Next to the device name, if available, the IP address on the local network and the MAC address (composed of 6 blocks of 2 digits that combine letters and numbers) are shown. It will also indicate if they are active on the network and how long they have been continuously connected.

![router2](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/router2.png?raw=true)

> ðŸ“– If we do not find this option in the router menus, we must **consult our operator** or search the Internet for the manual of our router. The steps to access this section vary depending on the router manufacturer and operator.

### Using third-party applications

If we do not want to deal with the different menus that some routers include, as some are in English, we can use third-party applications such as the ones shown below. However, the **most reliable and complete** information can only be found directly through our router.

- **Advanced IP Scanner**

Advanced IP Scanner is a free application with which we can quickly and easily know all the devices that are connected to our Wi-Fi network. The information it shows us is the same that we can get by accessing through the router, where we can see the name of the device, the assigned IP, the device manufacturer, and the MAC address. We can download Advanced IP Scanner directly from its [web page](https://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/es/).

![IP Scanner 1](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/ip-scanner1.png?raw=true)

- **Angry IP Scanner**

Another application with which we can also analyze the devices connected to our computer is Angry IP Scanner, an application available for free download and that in addition to **Windows**, is also available for **Linux** and **macOS**.

The download of Angry IP Scanner is available through its web page which can be accessed by clicking [here](https://angryip.org/download/#windows).

## How to eject users from a WiFi connection

The simplest and quickest method to expel anyone who has accessed our Wi-Fi network is to change the password of the Wi-Fi signal(s), if in addition to the 2.4 GHz network we also have the 5 GHz network (Plus as some providers call it) enabled. To change the password, the process varies depending on the manufacturer and operator, we must access the router (remember that the data is at the bottom of the router) and access the Wi-Fi section. Then we go to each of the two Wi-Fi signals (if we have more than one), we can identify them by the name they show and change the password to any other.

![WiFi connection](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/conexion-wifi.png?raw=true)

We must avoid using the name of our son together with his date of birth, the name of one of our pets, a nickname by which he knows us, or any other data that can easily be known by people around us who are looking for a free internet connection. In addition, if we have the option, we can **hide the Wi-Fi network** so that it is not shown around us. In this way, the devices already connected will still be able to connect, but it will not be available on any other device that we want to connect. If we want to connect a new device, we can uncheck the box, connect it, and hide the network again.

### How to prevent them from reconnecting**.

Once we have expelled the intruders from our WiFi network, it is time to take the appropriate measures to prevent anyone from sneaking in again.

1. **Use a secure password**

When choosing a password, we should avoid using any name that might be associated with us or our family. Neither should we use the names of our pets, nor dates of birth in combination with names. Nor should we use common names of well-known brands that we may like, nor car brands, fashion designers, clothing brands, soccer teams, or players... The most secure password is one that is formed by **letters, numbers, and symbols** in a random way and combining upper and lower case letters.

Applications that allow access to Wi-Fi networks use dictionaries with keywords that are used natively in most routers, so, if our router already comes with a password associated with the router, the first thing we must do is change it and create a new one, a password that, with many years ahead and through brute force applications, applications designed for this purpose can find out.

2. **Hiding the Wi-Fi network**

Another interesting method that we have available is to avoid the friends of the aliens accessing our password, Wi-Fi happens to hide the signal in our environment. Once we have connected all the devices to the Wi-Fi network again after having changed the password if it is the case, from the router, we can hide the Wi-Fi network so that no other device in its environment can **detect its presence** and try to find out the password using different methods, even if it gets to know the password, if it cannot access the signal, it will never have the opportunity to enter it.

3. **Activate MAC identification**

The last method that we also have at our disposal to prevent other people in our environment from accessing our connection is to configure the router to only accept connections from the MAC addresses that we have previously entered. Any computer that tries to connect to our network, knowing the password, if it does not have its MAC address registered **will never be able to access the content** offered by the router, that is to say, neither to the Internet signal nor to the files, folders or any other shared content. The MAC address is the license plate of the devices with internet connection, a unique and unrepeatable license plate for each device. While it is true that it can be spoofed, it is a very complicated process to do and not worth it.

## How to protect your Wi-Fi network from hackers?

With a few simple precautions on your Wi-Fi router, you will make it much more difficult to hack. As in many aspects of life, preventing Wi-Fi network hacks is easier and cheaper than dealing with a hacked router. Once this happens, the problem becomes significantly more difficult to solve, though not impossible.

It is very different if we have seen **intruders on our Wi-Fi network** that we are unaware of, or if on the other hand, it is a user or device that we don't want connecting to the network, but at some point, we permitted them. It may be someone who has come to our house, and we have given them the Wi-Fi key, for example. Be that as it may, we have different options to prevent a particular user or device from connecting to our network. Let's talk about the main ones we have.

1. **Change the router administrator credentials**

All routers have a username and password to access the router configuration. When you get a router, whether new or used, **change the username and password** immediately.

Wi-Fi network hackers know the default administration credentials of virtually every common router on the market. If someone can access your Wi-Fi network, they can try to connect to your router with that data. If you have never updated your login credentials after getting the router, it is easy to hack the router's password. And, if you bought the router from someone else, you can't be sure how old that data is. In any case, change it as soon as possible.

Set a new router password using [practices for creating a strong password](https://blog.avast.com/strong-password-ideas) or [create an untraceable password](https://www.avast.com/es-es/random-password-generator) with a random string of characters to prevent Wi-Fi network hackers from accessing your router.

2. **Change the Wi-Fi network password**

Undoubtedly, the best option to kick any user out of our network is to **change the Wi-Fi password**. Thus, any user or device that was connected to our network, is automatically out. However, in this case, we must take into account that not only a specific user would be locked out, but also any other connected device or user. We would have to reconfigure the new key or encryption in each case.

Whenever we create a new key we must follow the same pattern so that it is **strong and complex**: it must contain letters (upper and lower case), numbers, and other special characters, it is recommended that it is 12 characters or more, and if possible, that it is random.

3. **Create a MAC filtering**

Creating a **MAC filtering** alone will not greatly improve the security of our wireless network, but it could prevent a particular user or device from connecting. It is, therefore, one of the options we have to expel users from our Wi-Fi. We can especially kick out those who have less knowledge, and who have simply entered because they have found out the password for some reason.

To do this we have to identify the MAC address of that user. We can **enter the router**, which is usually accessed through the default gateway `192.168.1.1`, and enter the credentials. If we do not know what the gateway is we can easily find it out. We have to go to Start, open the Command Prompt, and then run the ipconfig command. It will show us a series of data including what we are interested in. This way we can access our device.

![filtrado MAC](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/filtrado-mac.png?raw=true)

The password is usually a generic one such as admin123, 1234, etc. However, it is highly recommended that we never leave this password and that we change it for a much stronger one that can keep cybercriminals away and that does not compromise our security at any time. The process will depend on the router we have, but in general, we will have to enter Wireless and access the MAC address filter option.

Here we will have to **enter the MAC address** of the device we want to prevent from connecting. It may belong to someone to whom we gave our password at some point or even a device we own that we do not want to have access to the network. We can create a whitelist so that only the devices we want can easily access it.

4. **Enable WPA2 (or WPA3) encryption**

WPA2 and WPA3, the second and third versions of the Wi-Fi Protected Access security protocol, protect your router against unauthorized access using AES encryption. This is the same type of encryption we use at Avast for our super-secure Avast SecureLine VPN, so you can imagine this is a good thing. All routers worth their salt have WPA2 encryption enabled, and newer models may have WPA3.

Enable WPA2 or WPA3 encryption to require anyone wishing to connect to your protected router to use the Wi-Fi password. Also, be sure to create a strong password by following smart practices for creating strong passwords. These simple steps will pose a serious obstacle to any Wi-Fi network hacker.

5. **Change the router's network name (SSID)**

When configuring the router (to change its administration credentials and set a secure password), change the SSID as well. SSID stands for *service set identifier*, which, simply put, is the name of your Wi-Fi network.

New routers often include the router brand name in the SSID and Wi-Fi network hackers can use this information to crack your password. Instead, **personalize the network name** so they don't know the type of router you have. The more clues you give a hacker, the easier their job will be.

Use all your creativity with the Wi-Fi network name: create a long and complex one. WPA encryption uses the SSID as part of its algorithm, so avoiding common or common network names will make the network more resistant to password hacking methods such as rainbow tables. Also, it's okay to let the neighbors read something funny.

6. **Disable WPS**

In addition to WPA2 or WPA3, many routers also have WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup), which means you can push a button or enter a PIN to connect, rather than using the password. While more convenient, the level of security plummets when you use buttons or PIN codes instead of passwords.

Anyone who can physically touch the router will also be able to press the WPS button and connect. A short PIN is much easier to crack in a brute force attack than a long, complicated password.

Unfortunately, not all routers allow you to disable WPS functions, but if you can, **disable WPS as soon as possible and set a password**.

7. **Disable remote or wireless management**

Remote management allows you to connect to the router's management settings from anywhere in the world. But unless you are a developer, there is very little chance that you will use this feature. If you disable it, you will only be able to access the settings when the PC is physically connected to the router via an Ethernet cable. Disabling remote management is a convenient way to avoid hackers.

8. **Update the router's firmware**

Firmware is the software that controls a specific piece of hardware (in this case, the router). Just like the PC's operating system and the programs or applications it uses, firmware can be updated. Firmware updates can protect the router against any [vulnerabilities](https://www.avast.com/es-es/c-exploits) detected in older versions of the firmware. Some routers may check for firmware updates, but you can always log into the router's administration settings, look for the firmware section, and check for updates there.

9. **Use a cybersecurity tool that protects your Wi-Fi network**

One of the easiest and simplest ways to protect the Wi-Fi network is to use a Wi-Fi network monitoring tool so you don't have to bother monitoring the network manually. Avast Free Antivirus includes a Wi-Fi Inspector that constantly scans your network for suspicious activity or devices, so you'll know exactly what's happening on your Wi-Fi network at all times.

![red Wi-Fi](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/red-wi-fi.png?raw=true)

10. **Reset router settings**

A bit **similar to the password change** mentioned above. If we reset the router and return to factory defaults, in case we have previously changed the password and configuration, all users are locked out of the router. After all, they would not know the new credentials and the configuration would not allow them to stay connected. It is a quick way to **expel any user**. Of course, once again we would be blocking access to all other users and devices. We would have to generate a new secure key.

11. **Disable Wi-Fi

This option will automatically lock out all users connecting through the wireless network. It will allow us to kick out any equipment that we have connected. However, this would only be valid if we do not want to use Wi-Fi. For example, if we are going to connect via cable and all we want is that there are no more devices that can connect. It is a more drastic measure but we also wanted to include it. Ultimately it is a solution that we can also carry out at any given time.

To do this we will have to log in to the router again. We can access the advanced settings, enter Wi-Fi, and, depending on our model, find the corresponding option to **disable the wireless network**. At any time we will be able to reverse the situation. It can even help us save time while changing the password or making any changes.

## Use applications to expel users from the WiFi network

We can also use external programs. One example is **NetCut**, which we talked about in a previous article. This software allows us to have control over all the **equipment connected** to our router.

In case we want to kick out one in particular, we can do it easily with this application. One more utility that we have available. Of course, in this case, we must take into account that we will have to install additional software on our computer. We must always download it from official sources and not make mistakes that may affect our security.

NetCut is an interesting program that allows us to expel a user from the wireless network. However, we can make use of other similar programs that can also be found for free on the Internet. There is a wide range of possibilities for different operating systems.

### Fing for cell phones

One of the first things we must do if we want to know who is accessing our router is to see the different connections. We can do this easily from the device itself and by accessing the settings, but we can also use a specific application to help us know who is connecting and from which device. Fing is an application that allows us to check simply if someone is using **our Internet if you are a beginner**, and you don't know how you can check it following other steps.

Fing also allows **finding intruders and blocking access** permanently or temporarily. It is an application for Android and iOS that we can download for free on our smartphone and that allows us to detect all the devices connected to the WiFi network.

Simply download the application to your cell phone and turn it on. It will automatically detect the devices that are connected to the network and show them in a list that you can see on your phone: the type of device it is (mobile, TV, game console, device, smart speakers...) and it will also show us the brand, model and **private IP address** of the device within our network.

We can tap inside the one we want to read more details about that device, the model, the release date, the operating system... We can access the settings or manage the device: we can remove it from the list, we can ping it, or access a timeline where we can see the different accesses. That's how easy it will be, with this app, to block someone who is stealing the Internet and avoid as soon as possible that they continue stealing Internet at home.

### Advantages of kicking out users

Unauthorized users can be a big source of problems for our Wi-Fi network and for our own security in many cases. Expelling them brings us different benefits that are very important for maintaining our security and privacy, as well as for the network to work in the right way. These benefits are:

- **Better security**

We must have good security in our network to avoid intruders and expel them at the moment. When our Wi-Fi network is accessed by unauthorized users, it can be a threat to the security of the network and to us. Access to other users' data is much easier. So they can steal personal information, or cause other types of damage to the system. Or even cause some kind of problem or commit a crime from our own network. By expelling them, we reduce this possibility in a very considerable way. Since, if any crime is committed from the network, the first responsible will be the owner of the network.

- **Better speed**

The more users there are on the network, the lower the speed and bandwidth that can be distributed. This will be noticed when we use our Internet connection to carry out any activity, worsening considerably the quality of the connection. By expelling users, we freed up the bandwidth they were using, thus improving the speed and overall performance of the network.

- **Increased privacy**

By ejecting unauthorized users, we greatly reduce the possibility that they **can access personal information**, which can be very sensitive. By expelling them, we improve the privacy of all users considerably. It is a good way to protect ourselves and to prevent all kinds of practices being carried out with our IP address or using our Internet access to do so.

- **Complying with regulations**

When it comes to any company or organization, having unauthorized users may mean that they are not complying with any rules or regulations. By expelling these users, we ensure that we comply with these regulations. This reduces the risk of a fine or sanction.
